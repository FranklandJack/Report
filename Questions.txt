Questions for Friday 2nd March.

1. Is the reference provided for acceptance rate applicable to our simulation?

2. How detailed should the explanation of Monte-Carlo be, do I need to explain it fully (i.e. method for computing multi-dimensional integrals with low error stochastically)? or can I just say it is a method for computing expectation values according to a probability distribution? Do I need to explain Markov chains?

3. Is my proof that leap frog preserves volume acceptable and is it too detailed? 

4. How is the value of <f(x)> related to <x,t|f(x)|x,t> related to <0|f(x)|0>, i.e. how do we know we are making measurements of the ground state, and how do we know they correspond to observable values in q.m?

5. What do we need to show for the monte-carlo simulation to be valid, ergodicity and detailed balance.
