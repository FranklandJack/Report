3. Methods:                  - Review of Monte-Carlo methods / how they work / detailed balance. 
                             - Hybrid Monte-Carlo: - Review of Hamiltonian dynamics, leapfrog, preservation of volume in PS.
                                                   - How to sample from a Hamiltonian using partition function, fictitious momenta.

                                                   - Show detailed balance satisfied.

4. Results/Discussions:      - Apply HMC algorithm to quantum mechanical systems bringing together sections 2 and 3. 
                             - Baby/test case QHO: - Ground and first excited state energies. (figures)
                                                   - <X^2> vs lattice spacing. (figures)
                                                   - Wavefunction. (figures)
                                                   - Make comparison to exact results for discrete theory.

                             - Repeat for QAO: - No analytic results.
                                               - Demonstrate problem of sampling from isolated modes in the probability distribution.

                             - Tempering Dynamics: - Explain what tempering dynamics is / how it works.
                                                   - Show volume in PS still preserved => detailed balance therefore valid modification.
                                                   - Show results of whether or not it worked for QHO (doesn't look like it will atm).
                                                   - (If it doesn't work try and find out why and discuss that here?)

5. General Conclusion:       - Discussion of results of HMC simulation.
                             - Results of HMC simulation + tempering / did it work / if it did work is it a justifiable improvement.

Appendicies: - Calculation of various analytic results for QHO
             - Quantum Virial Theorem.
